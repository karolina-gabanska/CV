<span><b>Invoice Processing Specialist</b></span>
<p>I am a self-motivated person willing to broaden horizons and gain new professional experience. 
I love learning foreign languages (French, English and Spanish). 
I have been studying French since 2013 and using it at my previous work on a daily basis. 
I am seeking for a place where I could grow professionally and contribute to company's development.</p>
